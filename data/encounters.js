Has spell books and such around, all doors are open since it would have no point of being locked.

A table sits near the edge of the pool, containing a bowl with snacks.</br></br>It's the toad's birthday, he'll explain, and he's invited everyone in the forest. However, the invitation specified a start time that has long passed, and he's mistaken you for the first guests to arrive. Obviously nobody else is coming. Realistically, this is because the toad is kind of insufferable since he only talks about things nobody can relate to, like toad politics or how his toad day was. He's not mean, just hard to get along with and awkward, so don't roleplay him like a jerk just more like a socially unaware nerd.</br></br>If you help the toad celebrate (give him a present, sing happy birthday, etc.) he'll be extremely happy but it'll take at least the rest of the day to do. He'll be happy to let you crash in his clearing overnight, most creatures avoid it because of how awkward toad is, so wandering monster checks should be few and have some sort of morale check as well to see if they want to risk having toad talk to them just to attack you. Toad won't help you fight unless he's hit, he'll squat in his pond trying to initiate awkward conversation with any visitors.</br></br>If you tell him you aren't there for his party, he'll be sad but leave you be, or possibly attack with a very poor reaction check. If you kill him, the rest of the woods will probably know. They didn't like Toad, but they also didn't dislike him. You're kind of a jerk.",
