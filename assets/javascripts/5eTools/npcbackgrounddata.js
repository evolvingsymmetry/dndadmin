"People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals.",
"Aspiration. Someday I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny.",
"Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others.",
"Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority.",
"Independence. When people follow orders blindly they embrace a kind of tyranny.",
"Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins.",
"Ideals aren't worth killing for or going to war for.",
"Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter.",
"Respect. All people, rich or poor, deserve respect.",
"Community. We have to take care of each other, because no one else is going to do it.",
"Change. The low are lifted up, and the high and mighty are brought down. Change is the nature of things.",
"Retribution. The rich need to be shown what life and death are like in the gutters.",
"People. I help people who help me--that's what keeps us alive.",
"Aspiration. I'm going to prove that I'm worthy of a better life."
